in this folder, we will consider several betahat: 
1) betahat from only target data
  1.1) betahat based on tau(LOOCV) with non informative synthetic data
  1.2) betahat based on  tau(kappa1_hat)  with non informative synthetic data
  1.3) betahat based on  tau(kappa1)  with non informative synthetic data(oracle)
2) betahat from target data and source data
  2.1) betahat based on tau(LOOCV) with informative source data
  2.2) betahat based on tau(kappa1_hat,kesee_hat) with informative synthetic data
  2.3) betahat based on tau(kappa1,kesee) with informative synthetic data(oracle)
